# Adrenaline
Adrenaline is a minimal, base performance modpack that tries to make the game as fast as possible.

This project was made using [Packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz). 

To export into a pack, use `packwiz modrinth export` or `packwiz curseforge export` in one of the version folders.

Honestly I don't know what else to put here, everything about the pack is already on the [Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline).
